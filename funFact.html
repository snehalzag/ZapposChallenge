            <p class="para1">
                These sturdy creatures are domestic animals used by the peoples of the Andes Mountains. (Their wild
                relatives are guanacos and vicuñas). Native peoples have used llamas as pack animals for centuries.
                Typically, they are saddled with loads of 50 to 75 pounds. Under such weight they can cover up to 20
                miles
                in a single day. Pack trains of llamas, which can include several hundred animals, move large amounts of
                goods over even the very rough terrain of the Andes.

                Llamas are willing pack animals but only to a point. An overloaded llama will simply refuse to move.
                These
                animals often lie down on the ground and they may spit, hiss, or even kick at their owners until their
                burden is lessened.

                <p class="para1">
                    Llamas graze on grass and, like cows, regurgitate their food and chew it as cud. They chomp on such
                    wads for some time before swallowing them for complete digestion. Llamas can survive by eating many
                    different kinds of plants, and they need little water. These attributes make them durable and
                    dependable even in sparse mountainous terrain.

            <p class="paraHeading"> Relationship With Humans</p>
            <p class="para1">
                Llamas contribute much more than transportation to the human communities in which they live. Leather is
                made from their hides, and their wool is crafted into ropes, rugs, and fabrics. Llama excrement is dried
                and burned for fuel. Even in death, llamas can serve their human owners—some people slaughter them and
                eat their meat.
